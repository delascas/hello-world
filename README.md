# hello-world
I want to code the world
I am a math teacher in Nigeria. I have just recently come across the Python programing software,and i love it. I wish to put some of my math knowledge into programing with Python.I need some help.
I have not written any code yet. I am  still learning how to use this platform.
Thank you all!
